# CITS2200 ‚Äì Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository serves as a comprehensive review of the coding components from the CITS2200 unit at the University of Western Australia (UWA). It includes re-implementations of lecture examples and lab exercises to reinforce understanding of key concepts in data structures and algorithms.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

* **Lecture Scripts**: Python scripts corresponding to various lectures:

  * `Lec3.py`
  * `Lec4.py`
  * `Lec5.py`
  * `Lec7.py`
  * `Lec12.py`
  * `Lec13.py`
  * `Lec14.py`

* **`.gitignore`**: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.

## üß† Topics Covered

The repository delves into several fundamental topics, including:

* Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
* Stacks and Queues
* Recursion and Iteration
* Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
* Graph Representations and Traversals
* Hash Tables and Collision Resolution
* Algorithm Complexity Analysis([GitHub][1])

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To explore or run the code:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/undergraduateuwa/CITS2200.git
   ```



2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd CITS2200
   ```



3. **Run a Python Script**:

   ```bash
   python Lec3.py
   ```



Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
